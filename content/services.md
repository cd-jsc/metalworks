# Our Services

We specialize in custom manufacturing solutions that meet the most demanding industrial requirements. Our state-of-the-art facilities and experienced team deliver precision, quality, and reliability in every project.

## Custom Roll Forming

Our advanced 20-pass roll forming line handles complex, multi-bend shapes with exceptional precision. We work with material gauges from 12 to 20 gauge steel, maintaining tolerances as tight as Â±1/32".

**Key Capabilities:**
- Complex geometries and multi-bend profiles
- High-speed production capabilities
- Precision tolerances
- Custom tooling design and manufacturing

## Custom Channel Strut

We manufacture commercially available channel strut at custom lengths, reducing waste and improving project efficiency. Our process eliminates the need for field cutting and ensures consistent quality.

**Features:**
- Any commercially available sidewall height
- Custom hole patterns and configurations
- Optimized lengths to reduce material waste
- Fast turnaround times

## Solar Racking Solutions

Specialized manufacturing for large-scale solar installations including channel strut, U-channel, and angle iron components designed for extreme weather conditions and long-term durability.

## Material Optimization

Our coil end welding system maximizes material utilization and minimizes waste, providing cost-effective solutions without compromising quality.

## Quality Assurance

Every project undergoes rigorous quality control testing to ensure components meet or exceed industry standards and customer specifications.
